## Delegate Using Tangle DApp

<Callout type="info">
You should have deposited your tokens to the multiasset delegation vault before you can delegate. See the [Deposit Using Tangle DApp page](./deposit-tangle.mdx) for more information. If you have already deposited **and** delegated your assets under the **Deposit** tab, you can skip this step.

Delegators are similar to stakers in a consensus system like nominated proof of stake (NPoS), but they delegate their tokens to an operator, and participate in the rewards and risks similar to staking on a validator.

### Step 1: Access Tangle DApp & Connect Wallet

- Open [Tangle DApp's Restaking: Delegate page](https://app.tangle.tools/restake/stake).
- Connect your wallet to the DApp by clicking on the **Connect Wallet** button on the top right and selecting your preferred wallet provider.

### Step 2: Delegate

1. Switch to the **Stake** tab on the Restaking page.
2. Ensure that you're connected to the appropriate network. You can switch networks by using the dropdown located at the top right corner of the page.
3. Click on the **Asset** dropdown, and select an asset from the modal. If the asset that you're looking for is not listed, ensure that you have correctly performed the deposit operation for that asset. Please note that your asset balance might be lower than expected or not available if you have already deposited and delegated at once under the **Deposit** tab.
4. Click on the **Select Operator** dropdown, and choose an operator from the list. You can also search for specific operators by entering their address in the search bar.
5. Enter the amount of assets that you'd like to delegate to the operator.
6. Review fees, unstake period, and bond less delay before proceeding.
7. If all the information is correct, the **Delegate** button should be enabled. Click on it to initiate the transaction.

### Step 3: Sign and Submit the Transaction

- Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.
- If successful, you should see the following confirmation toast notification:
