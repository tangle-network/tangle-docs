## Operators

Operators are noderunners that have tokens at stake and choose to restake them to enable participation in roles, which conduct the jobs produced by a blueprint instance. In esssence, Operators are service providers whose effectiveness and security is guarenteed by their restaked assets.

### Joining as an Operator

To participate in restaking, a user can join as an operator by providing a bond amount through the ``join_operators function. This registers the user as an operator and locks their bond, which is necessary for participating in the network and receiving rewards.
