## Leave as an Operator

Operators can leave the operator role by unstaking their tokens. The leave process is similar to the unstake process, which means its a two step process, first you schedule a leave operation 
and then you execute the leave operation after the leave delay period has passed. You can cancel the leave operation before it is executed.

## Schedule Operator Leave

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

Alternatively, you can access it via the tangle explorer:

- The tangle testnet is available at: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.tangle.tools#/explorer
- The tangle mainnet is available at: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Schedule Operator Leave

Ensure you have joined as an operator first, see [Join as an Operator](./join.mdx).

- Navigate to the **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.
