## Leave as an Operator

Operators can leave the operator role by unstaking their tokens. The leave process is similar to the unstake process, which means its a two step process, first you schedule a leave operation
and then you execute the leave operation after the leave delay period has passed. You can cancel the leave operation before it is executed.

## Schedule Operator Leave

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.
