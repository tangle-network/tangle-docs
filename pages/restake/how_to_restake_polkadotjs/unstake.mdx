## Unstake Using PolkadotJS

The first step to exit restake is to unstake your tokens. This is done by calling the `unstake` function, which releases the locked assets and returns them to the deposit vault.

Then, you can withdraw your assets from the deposit vault. See the [Withdraw page](./withdraw.mdx) for more information.

The unstake is a two step process:

1. Call the `schedule_unstake` function to schedule the unstake.
2. Call the `execute_unstake` function to execute the unstake after the unstake period.

### Schedule Unstake

To unstake, you need to call the `schedule_unstake` function. This function schedules the unstake.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Schedule Unstake

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.

### Cancel Delegator Unstake

To cancel the unstake, you need to call the `cancel_delegator_unstake` function. This function cancels the unstake.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

### Step 2: Cancel Delegator Unstake

Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.

### Execute Delegator Unstake

To execute the unstake, you need to call the `execute_unstake` function. This function executes the unstake. This function can only be called after the unstake period.
