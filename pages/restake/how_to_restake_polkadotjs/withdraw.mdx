## Withdraw Using PolkadotJS

<Callout type="info">
You can only withdraw your "undelegated" (unstaked) assets. Make sure you have undelegated your assets before withdrawing. See the [Unstake page](./unstake.mdx) for more information.
</Callout>

Withdrawing is the process of releasing assets from the multiasset delegation vault.

Similar to unstaking, it is composed of two steps:

1. A withdrawal request is **scheduled**, which will be available for execution after its unstake period.
2. After the unstake period, you can **execute** the withdrawal to actually release the assets.

### Accessing the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Testnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.tangle.tools#/explorer
- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Schedule Withdraw

The first step to complete a withdraw is to schedule a withdrawal. This is done by calling the `schedule_withdraw` function.

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

- Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.

### Execute Withdraw

The second step to complete a withdraw is to execute the withdrawal. This is done by calling the `execute_withdraw` function.

- Navigate to the **Developer** → **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.
