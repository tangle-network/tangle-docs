## Deposit Using PolkadotJS

Depositing is the process of allocating assets to the multiasset delegation vault. Deposits are required to participate in restaking (delegate).

Users can deposit LST assets to the multiasset delegation vault.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer
