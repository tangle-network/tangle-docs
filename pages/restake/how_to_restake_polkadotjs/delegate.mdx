## Delegate Using PolkadotJS

<Callout type="info">
You should have deposited your tokens to the multiasset delegation vault before you can delegate. See the [Deposit Using PolkadotJS page](./deposit.mdx) for more information.
</Callout>

Delegators are similar to stakers in a consensus system like nominated proof of stake (NPoS), but they delegate their tokens to an operator, and participate in the rewards and risks similar to staking on a validator.

To delegate, you need to call the `delegate` function. This function allocates assets to the chosen operator.

### Step 1: Access the PolkadotJS Interface

- Open [PolkadotJS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/).
- Connect to the Tangle Network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list.

For convenience, here are the PolkadotJS direct links for Tangle Testnet and Mainnet:

- Tangle Testnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-rpc.tangle.tools#/explorer
- Tangle Mainnet: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.tangle.tools#/explorer

### Step 2: Delegate

- Navigate to the **Developer** â†’ **Extrinsics** tab on PolkadotJS.

- Sign and submit the transaction. Make sure the account you are using has enough balance to cover the transaction fee.
