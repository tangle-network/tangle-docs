# Tangle Liquid Staking Rewards

### 1. **Earning Staking Rewards with Liquidity**

- **Benefit:** Liquid staking allows participants to earn staking rewards without locking their assets for extended periods. Users can continue to receive rewards while maintaining the ability to transfer or utilize their staked tokens elsewhere in the ecosystem.
- **Incentive:** This flexibility makes liquid staking appealing to users who want to maximize their asset efficiency without sacrificing liquidity. They can participate in DeFi activities, trade, or provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges, all while earning staking rewards.

### 2. **Reward Compounding**

- **Benefit:** Liquid staking offers the opportunity for users to easily compound their rewards by restaking their earnings or investing them in other protocols.
- **Incentive:** Participants can maximize their returns by reinvesting their staking rewards or using them in various DeFi protocols, creating a feedback loop of earning and compounding. This flexibility is especially appealing for users focused on maximizing their overall yield.
