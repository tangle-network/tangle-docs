## How to Join a Liquid Staking Pool Using Tangle DApp

### Step 1: Access Tangle DApp & Connect Wallet

- Open [Tangle DApp's Liquid Staking page](https://app.tangle.tools/liquid-staking).
- Connect your wallet to the DApp by clicking on the **Connect Wallet** button on the top right and selecting your preferred wallet provider.
- Connect to the desired Tangle network by selecting the appropriate network from the dropdown list. Note that liquid staking pools are only available on the networks in which they are created--If you don't see a specific pool that you're looking for, make sure you're connected to the correct network.

- Select a pool by clicking on the **All Pools** tab, clicking on a protocol to expand its list of pools.

### Step 3: Join Pool & Stake

- The lower input field displays the total amount of the selected pool's tokens that you'll receive from your deposit. This amount is calculated using the exchange rate and also includes the liquid staking fee, if applicable.
- Once you've double-checked all the transaction details, click on the **Join Pool & Stake** button to deposit your tokens into the selected pool, and proceed to confirm the transaction with your wallet.
