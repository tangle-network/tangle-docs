# Supported Assets on Tangle Restaking

Supported assets include all "liquid" assets on Tangle network, including liquid staked TNT tokens. The network does not limit or restrict the assets that can be used for restaking, but assets are preferred by adding them to a reward pool.

## Integrate New Assets

New assets may be added through on-chain governance and TNT community approval.

To propose new assets, [join the community discussion](https://commonwealth.im/tangle/discussions).
