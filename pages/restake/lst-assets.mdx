# Supported Liquid Staking Assets

<Callout type="info">
When performing liquid staking operations, ensure that you are using the correct network for the asset you are working with.
</Callout>

There are various assets supported for liquid staking operations. The important thing is that each asset may only be available on a specific network. For example, TNT is available on the Tangle Mainnet, while DOT will be available on the Tangle Parachain.

Support for additional assets may be added through on-chain governance, so join our Discord and Telegram channels to stay tuned for updates. If you happen to have suggestions for new assets, feel free to reach out!

### Supported assets on Tangle Mainnet:

- TNT

### Supported assets on Tangle Parachain (Coming Soon):

- DOT (Polkadot)
- BFC (Bifrost)
