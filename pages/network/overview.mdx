## Introduction

Tangle Network is an advanced blockchain platform designed for MPC coprocessors and infrastructure. It seamlessly integrates Multi-Party Computation (MPC) primitives with an innovative restaking mechanism, empowering developers to create groundbreaking privacy-enhancing solutions within a decentralized, crypto-economically secure landscape.

**Scale with MPC:**
Integrate Tangle's MPC-as-a-Service into your projects for scalable, secure development environments. Tangle serves as a core infrastructure for ZK applications across ecosystems.

**Build with MPC:**
Contribute to Tangle's modular protocol, expanding its capabilities through innovative upgrades. Enable cross-chain interactions via bridges, IBC, XCM, and ensure EVM compatibility for seamless interoperability.

**Earn with MPC:**
Earn rewards by providing essential cryptographic services in Tangle's restaking framework. The system incentivizes high-quality MPC services through direct restaking on available roles.

**Collaborate with MPC**
Join Tangle's diverse community of developers, researchers, dApp users, bridge users, and token holders. Participate in an advanced governance model, underpinned by a Distributed Key Generation protocol, which secures cross-chain applications.

## Key Features

- **MPC-as-a-Service (MaaS)**: : Tangle natively supports various multi-party computation primitives and zero-knowledge proving services, positioning the network as a core infrastructure for ZK applications across multiple ecosystems.

- **Restaking**: Tangle's restaking system seamlessly integrates with its MPCaaS infrastructure, incentivizing node operators to provide high-quality MPC services by allowing them to restake directly on available roles.

- **Interoperability**: Tangle enables fluid cross-chain interactions, from asset bridging to advanced cross-chain communication, through technologies such as private bridges, zkBridges, IBC pallets, and XCM.

- **EVM Compatibility**: The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as a conduit for compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum-based tools and applications, allowing developers to construct DApps, generate NFTs, and utilize ERC20 tokens across diverse networks.

## Services

Tangle Network offers a range of services to support the development and deployment of advanced cryptographic applications:

- **Signing as a Service (TSSaaS)**: Tangle provides threshold signatures as a service, enabling the creation of decentralized bridges, oracles, and custody solutions with robust security.

- **zkSNARKs as a Service (zkSaaS)**: Tangle offers proof generation as a service, allowing developers to outsource the proof generation process to a privacy-preserving infrastructure, addressing computational challenges faced by resource-constrained devices.

Tangle Network introduces an innovative platform to support cross-chain Zero-Knowledge (ZK) applications and enhance privacy in the blockchain ecosystem. With its unique offering of MPCaaS, restaking mechanism, and commitment to interoperability, Tangle is well-positioned to become a core infrastructure for enabling privacy-first and interoperable blockchain solutions.

## Roadmap

The following is subject to change as DAO governance supports different initiatives.

**COMPLETE: Phase 1**

- Launch democracy governance.
- Finalize Tangle Token Distribution
- Launch Incentivized testnet

**Phase 2**

- Launch mainnet on **April 10, 2024** and allocate TNT tokens.
- Deploy threshold signature scheme (TSS) as a service.
- Deploy restaking: linking validators to the MPC services.

**Phase 3**

- Launch cross-chain transfers.
- Initialize proof generation (ZKSaaS) as a service.
- Deploy ETH2 Light Client

**Phase 4**

- Remove Sudo and fully delegate authority to the on-chain community.
