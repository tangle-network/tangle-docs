# Network Parameters

This page outlines the key parameters and attributes of the Tangle network. Please note that some of these values may be subject to change via on-chain governance. For the most up-to-date and accurate values, it is recommended to check the constants directly by inspecting the [chain state](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate/constants) and/or [storage](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate).

### Fee Structure

- Dust (small, uneconomical to track amounts) is burned.
- Fees are split as follows:
  - 80% goes to the treasury
  - 20% goes to the block author (validator)
- 100% of tips go to block authors, similar to gas fees on other networks.

### Epoch and Era Durations

| Tangle  | Time      |
| ------- | --------- |
| Slot    | 6 seconds |
| Epoch   | 4 hours   |
| Session | 4 hours   |
