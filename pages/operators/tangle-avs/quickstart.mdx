# Tangle AVS: Quickstart Guide

The following is a guide outlining the steps to set up and utilize **Tangle AVS** (Actively Validated Services),
allowing you to run a Tangle Validator on **EigenLayer**'s network. If you do not have a Tangle node set up yet,
please review the **How to run a Tangle node** setup guide [here](../node-basics/quickstart.mdx).

This guide will help you get started with deploying the AVS and enabling cross-chain functionalities across multiple
blockchain protocols, specifically Tangle and EigenLayer. Further explanation on the cross-chain mechanisms offered by
Tangle AVS can be found in the [Cross-Chain](cross-chain.mdx) section.

For information on hardware requirements, see the [Hardware](../../operators/node-basics/hardware.mdx) section.

<Callout type="info">
    Ensure that you have everything necessary for running a Tangle node and have access to the necessary network
    configurations for EigenLayer or any other network you plan to connect to.
</Callout>

## Setup

The AVS is designed to automatically handle as much of the setup process as possible, so that you can focus on running your
Tangle node. Some specific configurations are in the midst of being implemented, and they will be added in a future update.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh filename="git clone" copy
   git clone https://github.com/tangle-network/avs.git tangle-avs
   cd tangle-avs
```

2. Build:

```sh filename="cargo build" copy
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

This AVS is under active development, thus being unstable. In the meantime, the tests can be run locally to see the capabilities of the Tangle AVS. The following command runs a test that automatically generates and runs everything needed.

```sh filename="cargo test" copy
RUST_LOG=gadget=trace cargo test test_full_tangle_avs -- --nocapture
```
