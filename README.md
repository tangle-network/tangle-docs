The docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format an extension of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), processed by [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main), and published to Webb Docs.

### Updating or Adding Content

For updating or adding content to the docs site, builders simply need to follow the below instructions. Please note,
if image assets are added to a given section you must provide both a dark and light version of the image.

**Updating existing content**

1. Navigate to the desired page to update (e.g. `/pages/overview.mdx`)
2. Make applicable changes
3. Test those changes locally `yarn install && yarn dev`

**Adding content for existing section**

1. Navigate to the desired documentation section (e.g. `/pages/overview.mdx/`)
2. Create a new mdx file that represents new page for desired section (e.g. `advanced.mdx`)
3. Write desired content for the new mdx file
4. Update the `_meta.json` file within the section directory to include your new page into the navigation
5. Test those changes locally `yarn install && yarn dev`. We request that you also run Prettier.

**Note:** To create a section with dropdown navigation, simply create a folder and specify the new navigation in `_meta.json`, create new your new files in the new directory along with its own `_meta.json` to outline the desired
navigation.
